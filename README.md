# About

This is the repository for the [Spotify-Nightbot](https://spotify-nightbot.edmurcardoso.com.br) project.
<br>
It is made using `PHP 7.3`, `Laravel 5.8` and `Docker`.
<br>
It aims to provide a nice integration between Spotify and Nightbot, in order to provide automated real-time in-chat alerts for your songs, some cool widgets to add to your livestream overlay, and on top of all a nice web UI to manage it all.
<br>
If you wished this project had a specific feature but it doesn't, feel free to request it on the [Issues](https://github.com/rumd3x/spotify-nightbot/issues) page and it will be looked into. Or if you prefer to add it yourself, just send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/rumd3x/spotify-nightbot/pulls) and it will be analysed.
<br>
Feel free to clone it, fork, edit, redeploy, whatever you like. However don't expect me to hold your hand while you are at it, since I do not plan on making a tutorial or documentation any time soon.
